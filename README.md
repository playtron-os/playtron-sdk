# Playtron SDKs

This repository contains multiple SDKs for interfacing with **Playtron GameOS** across different languages.

Each SDK provides access to platform-level features such as environment detection, remote PACT attestation, and Sui wallet integration.

---

## Requirements

- GameOS Beta 1.1+ (provides required native libraries)

---

## Testnet

If running the SDK for testing purposes and the goal is to target Sui `testnet` network, then you can change the network in GameOS like this:
```bash
ssh playtron@DEVICE_IP # Find in Settings â†’ Internet â†’ Wi-Fi â†’ IP Address
echo "PLAYTRON_ENOKI_NETWORK=testnet" > ~/.config/environment.d/PLAYTRON_ENOKI_NETWORK.conf
systemctl --user restart playserve
```

If needed to go back to mainnet, simply replace `testnet` above for `mainnet` and re-run that command.

---

## Provider App Id Requirements

In the Sui APIs, it is required to provider a `providerAppId`. This is the id associated to your game in the respective provider's store (ex: steam | epic | gog).

If running in `testnet`, it is possible to use an empty `providerAppId` string for quick iteration or if running the examples in this repo.
