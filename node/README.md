# Playtron GameOS Node.js SDK

Welcome to the official **Playtron GameOS Node.js SDK** â€” a JavaScript/TypeScript interface for integrating applications with the Playtron runtime. It provides access to platform-level features like remote PACT attestation and Sui wallet functions, via native bindings.

This SDK is designed for **Node.js apps running on GameOS** and includes TypeScript-compatible classes with async methods.

## Features

- TPM-based remote attestation
- Sui wallet integration for signing and executing transactions
- Detect if running on GameOS
- Native bindings via ffi-rs
- TypeScript support

---

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- GameOS Beta 1.1+ (provides required native libraries)

---

## Installation

1. Install SDK:
```bash
npm install @playtron/sdk
```

---

## Building and Testing Examples

All examples will only function properly in GameOS where the libraries and dlls are provided.

IMPORTANT: These examples will only work on GameOS Beta 1.1 version and up!
IMPORTANT 2: The wallet UI to approve/reject transactions might not be released with Beta 1.1 and come with a later version, thus making sui examples not fully testable.

### Attestation
